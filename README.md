# b2c-commerce-toolkit-for-insurance

The Commerce for Insurance solution connects Commerce, Industries, and Marketing Clouds to allow carriers to sell insurance directly to their shoppers. The current version offers quote-to-bind OmniScripts, upsell/cross-sell capabilities in cart, and multi-policy bundling.

We continue to release features and bugfixes. This is a community asset though, so please note that there is no ongoing Product/Engineering support and any contributions from the community (bug fixes, new features, enhancements) will be highly appreciated!
